#Week 1
- An introduction to DISMATH was discussed. I am absent by that time but still managed to ask my classmates for the lesson.

 | Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Formula | Logical Expression |
 | :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
 | ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
 | ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
 | v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
 | ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |

#Week 2 
- What I've learned is that the truth table is important in proving statements.
- The truth table must be memorized and understood to be able to be mastered.
- A declarative sentence is the structure required for a proposition. 
- I've learned about the terms negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, biconditional and implications.

 | Laws | Logical Equivalences |
 | :-----: |:-------:|
 | Identity Laws | p v F = p; p ∧ T = p |
 | Domination Laws | p v T = T; p ∧ F = F |
 | Negation Laws | p v ¬p = T; p ∧ ¬p = F |
 | Double Negation Law | ¬(¬p) = p |
 | Idempotent Laws | p v p = p; p ∧ p = p |
 | Commutative Laws | p v q = q v p; p ∧ q = q ∧ p |
 | Associative Laws | (p v q) v r = p v (q v r) |
 | Distributive Laws | p v (q ∧ r) = (p v q) ∧ (p v r) |
 | De Morgan's Laws | ¬(p ∧ q) = ¬p v ¬q |
 | Absorption Laws | p v (p ∧ q) = p; p ∧ (p v q) = p |
 
#Week 3
- I've learned that by using logical statements, you can prove statements.
- Truth and Validity are different things.
- Conclusions are dependent on the premises.
- There are differences in the quantifiers.
- Rules of Inference were taught.
- Knowing if an argument is a fallacy or not is important.

#Week 4
- I've learned that there are different types of proofs like the direct proof and its types.
- I also have learned on when and how a type of proof should be used.
- Proof by contraposition and contradiction are indirect methods of proof.
- Vacuous and Trivial proofs were also discussed.

#Week 5
- One must show that assuming the negation of a premise is true leads to a contradiction when it comes to proof of contradiction. We have tested different conditions and premises using the proof of contradiction.
- In this proof, according to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
- It is a combination of a direct and indirect proof when it comes to proof of equivalence.
